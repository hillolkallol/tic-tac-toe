 * TicTacToe
 * TicTacToe is a simple board game: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SdW0_wTX5c
 *
 * Caution: Just for fun!!
 * Haven't captured a few edge cases (i.e. wrong user input, index out of bound)
 * Will be fixed in the next release! :p :p
 *
 * Wiki:
 * Tic-tac-toe (American English), noughts and crosses (Commonwealth English), 
 * or Xs and Os, is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. 
 * The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner. 
 * It is a solved game with a forced draw assuming best play from both players. 
 * Reference: Wikipedia- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe
 * 
 * **********************************************************
 * This game has two main characteristics- Move and Winner Check.
 * CheckWinner method will be called after each move.
 * 
 * Before executing move, validMove method will be called from the client side just to check if the move is valid.
 * If the move is valid, the move method will be called.
 * The sign will be planted in the board (based on given row and col)
 * Then the checkWinner method will be called.
 * Last thing we need to check is if the match is a draw!
 * 
 * Next thing is to check if the player is the winner after the last move.
 * Check-
 * * if all the rows contain same sign OR
 * * if all the columns contain same sign OR
 * * if all diagonal or anti-diagonal boxes contain same sign
